# Number Recognition

The repository contains simple Python scripts that allow to train a neural network model to recognize numbers in 64x64 images. The GUI allows User to provide new training and validation data, train new model with custom parameters and verify the model precision.

The first tab of the GUI allows the User to draw a number on the Canvas and save it in the appropriate directory (according to the given class name):

The User is able to use the provided data to train new model with a given name, batch size and number of epochs:

After starting the training, the User can track the progress on the progress bar:

Once the training is completed, the results are displayed allowing the User to repeat the training or accept the model:

The second tab of the GUI allows the User to choose one of the available models and predict the number drawn in the Canvas:
