# Number Recognition

The repository contains simple Python scripts that allow to train a neural network model to recognize numbers in 64x64 images. User is able to provide new training and validation data and verify the model accuracy with the GUI.

The first tab of the GUI allows the User to draw a number on the canvas and save it in the appropriate directory (according to the given class name).

The second one uses the model to predict the number drawn by the User.
